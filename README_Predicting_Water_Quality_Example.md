#Predicting Water Quality
Documentation Date: 07/02/2023 <br>
Author: Jake Meyer

## Project Description
The focus for this project was to construct a model to predict whether 
water was potable based on certain water quality measurements. 
The data set used for this analysis was from Kaggle (Aditya Kadiwal). 
The CRISP-DM methodology was followed with Data Understanding, 
Data Preparation, Predictive Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment stages.

## Project Environment Overview
The project was completed in Jupyter Notebook (through Anaconda Navigator) 
via Python. All relevant libraries are called out in the Import Necessary 
Libraries section of the code.

## Data Preprocessing
Univariate, Multivariate, and additional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
was performed in depth on the data set. All variables were retained
in the dataset. The data was separated into Training (80%) and Test
(20%) subsets.

## Model Training
The classification problem had five potential models trained and evaluated:
Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest Classifier, 
Adaboost, Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression. 

## Model Evaluation
For this classification problem, Accuracy Test, Accuracy Train,
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were used. The primary metric was Accuracy 
Test.

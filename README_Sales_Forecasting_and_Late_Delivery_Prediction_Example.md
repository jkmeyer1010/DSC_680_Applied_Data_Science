# Sales Forecasting and Late Delivery Prediction
Documentation Date: 07/02/2023 <br>
Author: Jake Meyer

## Project Description
The focus for this project was centered around Supply Chain Analytics. 
The two main focuses were Sales Forecasting and Late Delivery Prediction 
with data from DataCo from Mendeley Data. The CRISP-DM methodology was 
followed to highlight challenges and determine the best models 
fit to the data. The Sales Forecasting problem was treated as a 
regression issue and the Late Delivery Prediction was 
treated as a classification problem.

## Project Environment Overview
The project was completed in Jupyter Notebook (through Anaconda Navigator) 
via Python. All relevant libraries are called out in the Import Necessary 
Libraries section of the code.

## Data Preprocessing
Univariate, Multivariate, and additional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
was performed in depth on the data set. All columns irrelevant to 
Sales Forecasting or Late Delivery prediction were removed initially. 
In addition, customer names, emails, and passwords were removed from 
the analysis to retain data privacy. Please be aware of this privacy concern
within the data set if an alternative analysis is performed. The data
preparation for the model included features that were strongly correlated
with the target variables of Sales and Late Deliver Risk. The data was 
separated into Training and Test subsets.

## Model Training
Models used for Sales Forecasting included Linear Regression, 
Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. 
Models used for Late Delivery Prediction included Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics were compared for models within each respective problem. 
For Sales Forecasting, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE),
R-squared Train, and R-squared Test metrics were used. The primary metric was
R-squared Test. For Late Delivery Prediction, Accuracy Test, Accuracy Train,
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were used. The primary metric for the 
classification problem was Accuracy Test.

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Project Description</span>
<span class="s1">The focus for this project was to construct a model to predict whether </span>
<span class="s1">water was potable based on certain water quality measurements. </span>
<span class="s1">The data set used for this analysis was from Kaggle </span><span class="s2">(</span><span class="s1">Aditya Kadiwal</span><span class="s2">)</span><span class="s1">. </span>
<span class="s1">The CRISP-DM methodology was followed with Data Understanding, </span>
<span class="s1">Data Preparation, Predictive Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment stages.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Supporting Files </span>
<span class="s1">The dataset used for this analysis can be found through the link below</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">[</span><span class="s1">Prediction of Water Quality Dataset</span><span class="s2">](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Project Environment Overview</span>
<span class="s1">The project was completed in Jupyter Notebook </span><span class="s2">(</span><span class="s1">through Anaconda Navigator</span><span class="s2">) </span>
<span class="s1">via Python. All relevant libraries are called out in the Import Necessary </span>
<span class="s1">Libraries section of the code.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Data Preprocessing</span>
<span class="s1">Univariate, Multivariate, and additional Exploratory Data Analysis </span><span class="s2">(</span><span class="s1">EDA</span><span class="s2">) </span>
<span class="s1">was performed in depth on the data set. All variables were retained</span>
<span class="s1">in the dataset. The data was separated into Training </span><span class="s2">(</span><span class="s1">80%</span><span class="s2">) </span><span class="s1">and Test</span>
<span class="s2">(</span><span class="s1">20%</span><span class="s2">) </span><span class="s1">subsets.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Model Training</span>
<span class="s1">The classification problem had five potential models trained and evaluated</span><span class="s2">:</span>
<span class="s1">Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest Classifier, </span>
<span class="s1">Adaboost, Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression. </span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Model Evaluation</span>
<span class="s1">For this classification problem, Accuracy Test, Accuracy Train,</span>
<span class="s1">Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were used. The primary metric was Accuracy </span>
<span class="s1">Test. </span>

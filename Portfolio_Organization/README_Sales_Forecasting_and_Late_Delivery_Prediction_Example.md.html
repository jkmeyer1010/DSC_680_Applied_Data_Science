<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Project Description</span>
<span class="s2">The focus for this project was centered around Supply Chain Analytics. </span>
<span class="s2">The two main focuses were Sales Forecasting and Late Delivery Prediction </span>
<span class="s2">with data from DataCo from Mendeley Data. The CRISP-DM methodology was </span>
<span class="s2">followed to highlight challenges and determine the best models </span>
<span class="s2">fit to the data. The Sales Forecasting problem was treated as a </span>
<span class="s2">regression issue and the Late Delivery Prediction was </span>
<span class="s2">treated as a classification problem. </span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Supporting Files</span>
<span class="s2">The dataset used for this analysis can be found through the link below</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">DataCo Data Set</span><span class="s1">](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gx2fvg2k6/5)</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Project Environment Overview</span>
<span class="s2">The project was completed in Jupyter Notebook </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">through Anaconda Navigator</span><span class="s1">) </span>
<span class="s2">via Python. All relevant libraries are called out in the Import Necessary </span>
<span class="s2">Libraries section of the code.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Data Preprocessing</span>
<span class="s2">Univariate, Multivariate, and additional Exploratory Data Analysis </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">EDA</span><span class="s1">) </span>
<span class="s2">was performed in depth on the data set. All columns irrelevant to </span>
<span class="s2">Sales Forecasting or Late Delivery prediction were removed initially. </span>
<span class="s2">In addition, customer names, emails, and passwords were removed from </span>
<span class="s2">the analysis to retain data privacy. Please be aware of this privacy concern</span>
<span class="s2">within the data set if an alternative analysis is performed. The data</span>
<span class="s2">preparation for the model included features that were strongly correlated</span>
<span class="s2">with the target variables of Sales and Late Deliver Risk. The data was </span>
<span class="s2">separated into Training and Test subsets.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Model Training</span>
<span class="s2">Models used for Sales Forecasting included Linear Regression, </span>
<span class="s2">Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. </span>
<span class="s2">Models used for Late Delivery Prediction included Logistic Regression, </span>
<span class="s2">Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Model Evaluation</span>
<span class="s2">Evaluation metrics were compared for models within each respective problem. </span>
<span class="s2">For Sales Forecasting, Mean Absolute Error </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">MAE</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">, Mean Squared Error </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">MSE</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">,</span>
<span class="s2">R-squared Train, and R-squared Test metrics were used. The primary metric was</span>
<span class="s2">R-squared Test. For Late Delivery Prediction, Accuracy Test, Accuracy Train,</span>
<span class="s2">Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were used. The primary metric for the </span>
<span class="s2">classification problem was Accuracy Test. </span>
